# What is a dynamic treatment regimen?

A **dynamic treatment regimen (DTR)** is

- an *intervention* design that 
- adapts the type, timing, intensity, or dose of treatment over time
- according to a patient's specific and changing needs.

--

In practice, a dynamic treatment regimen is a sequence of decision rules that can be used to guide how treatment can be adapted and readapted to an individual.

--

### Sounds a lot like clinical practice!

**MANY other names**: adaptive intervention, adaptive treatment strategy, individualized treatment rule, treatment algorithm, individualized intervention...

# A dynamic treatment regimen is an *intervention design*, NOT an experimental design.

We'll talk about experiments soon!

---
# 5 components of a DTR

Dynamic treatment regimens consist of

1. Decision points
1. Tailoring variable(s)
1. Intervention options
1. Decision rule(s)
1. Proximal and distal outcomes

---
# Example DTR: Alcohol Use Disorder

- **Naltrexone** is known to diminish pleasurable effects of alcohol `r Citep(bib, "oslinTargetingTreatmentsAlcohol2006", max.names = 1)`

- Response to naltrexone is heterogeneous (adherence, biology, social support, etc.) `r Citep(bib, "nahum-shaniSMARTDataAnalysis2017", max.names = 1)`

- Heterogeneity necessitates a supportive intervention alongside naltrexone
  - **Medical management**: face-to-face clinical support + adherence monitoring
  - **Combined behavioral intervention**: targets patient's motivation for change, emphasizes social support `r Citep(bib, "longabaughOriginsIssuesOptions2005", max.names = 1)`

# Example DTR: Decision Points

.fl.w-third[
A **decision point** is a time at which treatment might be adapted
to the individual.

- **Decision point 1:** Treatment outset &#8212; decide how to initiate treatment

- **Decision point 2:** Adjust treatment after 8 weeks

---
# Example DTR: Tailoring Variables

.fl.w-third[
A **tailoring variable** is used to individualize treatment at each decision point.

- "Static": age, baseline risk, etc.
- "Dynamic": adherence to treatment, disease severity, etc.

The DTR recommends an intervention option for each level of the tailoring variable.

---
# Example DTR: Tailoring Variables

.fl.w-third[
Here, the tailoring variable is the **number of self-reported heavy drinking days following treatment initiation**.

- $\geq$ 2 heavy drinking days $\rightarrow$ _non-responder_

- $<$ 2 heavy drinking days $\rightarrow$ _responder_
]

  ]
  ]
]

---
# Some Notes on Tailoring Variables

Note that the tailoring variable is _pre-specified_ and _well-defined_.

Tailoring variables **are part of the intervention**!
  
Should be based on _practical_, _ethical_, or _scientific_ considerations.

  - **Practical**: You might save more intense or costly intervention options for those who need it most (e.g., non-responders)
  - **Ethical**: You might have an ethical obligation to modify treatment for a particular subset of individuals
  - **Scientific**: You might have empirical evidence suggesting that responders need a different type of intervention than do non-responders

---
# Example DTR: Intervention Options

.fl.w-third[
- **Intervention options** at each decision point might be aspects of treatment: type, intensity, dose, delivery method, timing, etc.

- Here, intervention options are combinations of _naltrexone_, _medical management_, and _combined behavioral intervention_

# Example DTR: Intervention Options

In subsequent stages, could be _adaptation strategies_ like "augment", "intensify" or "stay the course".

# Example DTR: Proximal & Distal Outcomes

A dynamic treatment regimen's design should be guided by both short-term (**proximal**) and long-term (**distal**) outcomes

- **Distal outcomes** are the long-term goals of the DTR
  - Long-term, example DTR should reduce _likelihood of alcohol use relapse_
  
- **Proximal outcomes** are the near-term goals of the DTR; perhaps a mechanism by which we can achieve the distal outcome.
  - Short-term, we want to lower risk of relapse by reducing the _proportion of drinking and heavy-drinking days over 8 weeks after adaptation_ `r Citep(bib, "leiSMARTDesignBuilding2012", max.names = 1)`
  
---
# Scientific Questions about DTRs

Often unanswered questions about how to sequence and adapt interventions! Typically related to
  - relative effectiveness of different DTRs
  - relative effectiveness of different intervention options
  - how intervention options work with/against each other

--

### For example:
1. Which treatment option should the dynamic treatment regimen begin with?
1. How should we modify treatment for initial non-responders?
1. How should we modify treatment for initial responders?
1. How do we _define_ response/non-response?
1. How should we time decision points?

---
# Alcohol Use Disorder: Scientific Questions

- How do we define non-response to naltrexone in the context of a dynamic treatment regimen?
  - Unclear how many heavy drinking days indicate a need to augment treatment

- What treatments should be offered following the initial intervention (naltrexone + medical management)?
  - More intense support for non-responders?
  - Do responders need a supportive intervention alongside naltrexone?

--

.center[## Let's now discuss an experimental design which can help answer these questions]

# Sequential, Multiple-Assignment Randomized Trials (SMARTs)

![:scale 40%](https://c.tenor.com/iTzPmH_TIGIAAAAd/get-smart-maxwell-smart.gif)

---
# SMARTs

A **sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial** is _one type_ of randomized trial design that can be used to answer questions at multiple stages of the development of a high-quality dynamic treatment regimen.

--

The key feature of a SMART is that some (or all) participants are randomized _more than once_.

---
# How do SMARTs inform DTR development?

Randomizations in a SMART correspond to open scientific questions about constructing a dynamic treatment regimen!

In ExTENd,

- First randomization seeks to answer a question about definition of non-response

- Second randomization in responders investigates whether lower-intensity medical management ("telehealth") is needed as maintenance therapy

- Second randomization in non-responders looks at the effect of naltrexone in the context of combined behavioral intervention + medical management

# Do I need a SMART?

SMARTs are designed to answer questions about the development of high-quality dynamic treatment regimes.

Consider a SMART if...

1. You want to develop a DTR
1. There are open questions preventing the construction of an effective DTR
1. There are open questions at _multiple decision points_ within a DTR

--

If any of these aren't true, you don't need a SMART!

# Do I need a SMART?

Not all research on dynamic treatment regimens requires a SMART!

It may be appropriate to consider a "singly-randomized" alternative; see `r TextCite(bib, "almirallDevelopingOptimizedAdaptive2018")`.

---
# A small misconception about SMARTs

Sometimes, SMARTs are referred to as "adaptive" trials. This is not necessarily correct.
  - In an _adaptive trial_, data collected throughout the trial is used to modify _features of the trial itself_. (e.g., randomization probabilities, arms, etc.)
  
  - **SMARTs are typically _fixed_ designs.** All participants move through the trial as it was initially designed.
  
  
In adaptive trials, the _trial_ is adaptive. SMARTs are designed to address questions about _interventions_ that are adaptive. See `r TextCite(bib, "seewaldSequentialMultipleAssignment2021")` for more details.

---
# Recap: What do we know so far?

So far, we've learned

- what a dynamic treatment regimen is
- some scientific questions one might ask about developing a dynamic treatment regimen
- an experimental design that's useful for addressing questions related to multiple stages of dynamic treatment regimens (SMART)
- When SMARTs may or may not be useful.

.center[### Now, let's discuss some principles which guide the design of a high-quality SMART.]

# Design and Analysis Considerations for SMARTs

---
# More on Tailoring Variables

Tailoring variables are often used to **restrict randomization** (recommend different intervention options to different subgroups of participants).

Tailoring variables should be **well-justified**: remember, they're part of the DTRs!
  - Should be relatively easy to measure *in situ*
  - Assignment should be systematic
  
Secondary data analysis (Q-learning) can be used to discover "candidate" tailoring variables for future work or more deeply tailored DTRs.

You do **not** need to restrict randomization in a SMART! If you don't have good reason to embed a tailoring variable, don't do it.


---
# Primary & Secondary Aims

Focus on a few scientific aims about developing a high-quality DTR.


- **Primary aim:** Choose sample size based on this aim
  - Commonly a comparison of groups of experimental conditions
  - Should be related to scientific questions about adaptive interventions

- **Secondary aims:** Leverage rich data on treatment sequences to further inform a more deeply-tailored DTR

# Recap

SMARTs are experimental designs which are used to address questions at multiple stages of the development of dynamic treatment regimens.

Ultimately, the guiding principle of designing a SMART is "keep it simple".

Primary aims of a SMART should be focused on developing dynamic treatment regimens.

Sample size and analytic considerations for primary aims can often leverage familiar tools, and more advanced methods are available for more complex questions.
